========================
# ESAPI script "EB_BioAL"
========================
# Background:
In radiation oncology, different fractionation schemes
can be compared converting the actual dose into the equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2).
The focus of the current project was to create an ESAPI script (Eclipse Scripting API)
for this kind of biological dose correction of the 3D dose matrix displayed
in the radiation treatment planning system Eclipse
(Aria, Varian Medical Systems, A SIEMENS Healthineers Company).
Thereby, the goal was to make the biological dose correction topologically visible by conversion
of the entire 3D dose distribution, thereby providing an additional tool for plan evaluation.
# Results:
In C#, a script for the biological dose correction of the 3D dose matrix was generated ("EB_BioAL").
The script was implemented and successfully tested using real life patient cases.
# Conclusion:
The above mentioned software was developed and implemented.
Tests were performed on several patient plans
and confirm the correct functioning of the ESAPI script "EB_BioAL".
A clinical test run will be started.
